		<p>Hello fellow New Yorker; you've taken the first step towards volunteering!
			We know that it can get overwhelming to figure out where to give your time to,
			when there are so many places looking for help out there. We created this site
			to help you make the best decision possible at a glance, instead of having to
			spend an hour on Google Maps. ;)</p>

		<hr class="solid">

		<p>NYCare displays nearby resources that are looking for volunteer assistance in
			New York City (such as food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and
			more) on an easy-to-use map locator, without all the clutter.</p>

		<p>Our goal is to provide an intuitive and simple tool that hosts all the information
			a volunteer would need at first glance: the nearest locations from a specified zip code,
			and a location's address and contact information, using the filters to look up different
			types of services.</p>

		<p>To build this site, we used HTML & CSS for the frontend, and Javascript for
			the backend. We retrieved our database from NYC Open Data, and displayed
			the volunteer sites on a map provided through Leaflet.</p>

		<hr class="solid">

		<p>Thank you for dropping by NYCare, and thank you for making the world a better place.</p>

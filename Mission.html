	<p>Hello fellow New Yorker; you've taken the first step towards volunteering!
		We know that it can get overwhelming to figure out where to give your time to,
		when there are so many places looking for help out there. We created this site
		to help you make the best decision possible at a glance, instead of having to
		spend an hour on Google Maps. ;)
	</p>
	<p>Thank you for dropping by NYCare, and thank you for making the world a better place.
	</p>

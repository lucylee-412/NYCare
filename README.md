NYCare displays nearby resources that are looking for volunteer assistance in New York City (such as food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and more) on an easy-to-use map locator, without all the clutter.

Our goal is to provide an intuitive and simple tool that hosts all the information a volunteer would need at first glance: the nearest locations from a specified zip code, and a location's address and contact information, using the filters to look up different types of services.

Likewise, a site visitor who is looking for assistance can also use our website to search for nearby centers offering immediate aid. Redirect links to the appropriate applications and contact forms will be given.

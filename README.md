NYCare displays nearby resources that are looking for volunteer assistance in New York City, such as food pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and more on an easy-to-use map locator, without all the clutter.

Our goal is to provide an intuitive and simple tool that hosts all the information a volunteer would need at first glance: the nearest locations from a specified zip code, a location's contact information and hours open, and filters for different services.

Likewise, a site visitor who is looking for assistance can use our website to filter out centers that are offering immediate aid. Redirect links to the appropriate applications and contact forms will be given.
